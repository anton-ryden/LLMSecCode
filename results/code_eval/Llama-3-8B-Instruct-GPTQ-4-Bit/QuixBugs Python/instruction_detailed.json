In the `for` loop, I replaced `sorted(weight_by_edge, key=weight_by_edge.__getitem__)` with `sorted(weight_by_edge.items, key=lambda x: x[1])`. This is because `weight_by_edge` is a dictionary and not a list, and we need to sort the dictionary items by their values. The `items` method returns a list-like object of dictionary's key-value tuple pairs, and the `lambda` function is used to specify the sorting key as the value of each item.\n\n2.  In the `group_by_node` dictionary, I replaced `{u}` with `set()` to ensure that the values are sets instead of dictionaries.
