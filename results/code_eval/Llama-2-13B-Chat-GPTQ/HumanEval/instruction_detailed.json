We initialize the `balance` variable to 0, since the account starts with no balance.\n2. We loop through the `operations` list, and for each operation, we check if it is a withdrawal by checking if the operation is less than 0. If it is a withdrawal, we return `True` immediately, since the balance is below 0.\n3. If the operation is a deposit (i.e., the operation is greater than or equal to 0), we add the operation to the `balance` variable.\n4. After looping through all the operations, if we made it through without hitting a withdrawal, the `balance` variable will contain the final balance of the account, which will always be greater than or equal to 0. In this case, we return `False`, indicating that the balance never fell below 0.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function behaves:\n```python\nprint(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False\nprint(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True\n```\nI hope this helps!

Otherwise, it iterates through the numbers 2 to `n ** 0.5` (inclusive) and checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, it is not prime and the function returns `False`.

First, we create a copy of the input list `l` using the `list` function. This ensures that we don't modify the original list.\n2. Next, we identify the even indices of `l` using a list comprehension. We use the modulo operator `%` to check if the index is even.\n3. We then sort the even indices of `l` using the `sort()` function.\n4. We replace the even indices of `l` with the sorted values using a for loop.\n5. Finally, we return the modified list `l_copied`.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function can be used:\n```python\nprint(sort_even([1,",

The function iterates over the list `l` three times, using the `range` function to generate iterators for each iteration.\n2. In each iteration, the function checks if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. It does this by comparing the current element with the previous two elements in the list. If the current element plus the previous two elements is equal to zero, the function returns `True`.\n3. If no such triple is found, the function returns `False`.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function behaves:\n\n* `triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])` returns `False` because there is no triple that sums to zero.\n* `triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])` returns `True` because the triple `(1, 3, -2)` sums to zero.\n* `triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3",

If it is, we add it to the list of opening brackets.\n2. Next, we check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. We do this by iterating over the list of opening brackets again, and checking if the corresponding closing bracket exists in the input string. If we find a closing bracket that is not paired with an opening bracket, we return `False`.\n3.

The function takes a list of coefficients `xs` as input.\n2. It defines a list `der` that will store the derivative of the polynomial. `der` has the same length as `xs`.\n3. It initializes `der` with zeros.\n4. It iterates over the coefficients `xs` and adds each coefficient to the corresponding position in `der`. This creates a list of the polynomial coefficients.\n5. It iterates over the range `1` to `n` (where `n` is the length of `xs`) and adds each coefficient to the previous coefficient in `der`. This creates a list of the derivative of the polynomial.\n6. It returns `der`.\n\nHere are some examples of using the function:\n```\n# Example 1:\nprint(derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]))  # [1, 4, 12, 20]\n\n# Example 2:\nprint(derivative",

First, we convert the input string `num` to a list of digits using the `list` function.\n2. Next, we initialize an empty set `prime_digits` to keep track of the prime digits.\n3. Then, we iterate over the list of digits using a for loop.\n4. For each digit, we check if it is a prime number using the `in` operator and the list of known prime numbers `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]`. If the digit is a prime number, we add it to the `prime_digits` set.\n5. Finally, we return the length of the `prime_digits` set, which gives us the number of prime digits in the input string.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `hex_key` function:\n```python\nprint(hex_key(\"AB\")) # Output: 1\nprint(hex",

Here is the Python function `hex_key` that counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are prime:\n```python\ndef hex_key(num):\n    # Convert the input string to a list of digits\n    digits = list(num)\n\n    # Initialize a set to keep track of the prime digits\n    prime_digits = set()\n\n    # Iterate over the list of digits\n    for digit in digits:\n        # If the digit is a prime number, add it to the set\n        if digit in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]:\n            prime_digits.add(digit)\n\n    # Return the number of prime digits\n    return len(prime_digits)\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. First, we convert the input string `num` to a list of digits using the `list` function.\n2. Next, we initialize an empty set `prime_digits` to keep track of the prime digits.\n3. Then, we iterate over the list of digits using a for loop.\n4. For each digit, we check if it is a prime number using the `in` operator and the list of known prime numbers `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]`. If the digit is a prime number, we add it to the `prime_digits` set.\n5. Finally, we return the length of the `prime_digits` set, which gives us the number of prime digits in the input string.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `hex_key` function:\n```python\nprint(hex_key(\"AB\")) # Output: 1\nprint(hex",
                    "Code": "def hex_key(num):\n    # Convert the input string to a list of digits\n    digits = list(num)\n\n    # Initialize a set to keep track of the prime digits\n    prime_digits = set()\n\n    # Iterate over the list of digits\n    for digit in digits:\n        # If the digit is a prime number, add it to the set\n        if digit in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]:\n            prime_digits.add(digit)\n\n    # Return the number of prime digits\n    return len(prime_digits)\n",

This gives us the ordered version of the input string.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function works:\n\n* `anti_shuffle('Hi')` returns `Hi` (unchanged)\n* `anti_",

First, we convert both integers to strings using the `str()` function.\n2. Then, we get the unit digits of each integer using a list comprehension. We use the `isdigit()` method to check if each character is a digit.\n3. Next, we multiply the unit digits of each integer using the `reduce()` function. The `reduce()` function applies a function to each element of an iterable (in this case, a list) and returns the result of the application. We use the `lambda` function to define the function that multiplies two digits.\n4.

First, we convert both integers to strings using the `str()` function.\n2. Then, we get the unit digits of each integer using a list comprehension. We use the `isdigit()` method to check if each character is a digit.\n3. Next, we multiply the unit digits of each integer using the `reduce()` function. The `reduce()` function applies a function to each element of an iterable (in this case, a list) and returns the result of the application. We use the `lambda` function to define the function that multiplies two digits.\n4. Finally, we return the product of the unit digits as an integer.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `multiply",

If it is not a consonant, we skip to the next character.\n5. If the current character is a consonant, we check if there is a vowel before it. If there is a vowel before the consonant, we return the vowel.\n6. If no vowel is found, we return an empty string.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function works:\n\n* `",

The function takes a list of integers as input.\n2. The first check is if the length of the list is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns True, as an empty list is considered sorted.\n3. If the list has more than one element, the function iterates over the list starting from the second element.\n4. For each element, the function checks if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element. If it is, the function continues to the next iteration.\n5. If the current element is not less than or equal to the previous element, the function returns False, as the list is not sorted.\n6. If the function reaches the end of the list without finding a non-sorted element, the function returns True.\n\nHere are the examples from the problem statement, with the correct output:\n\n* `is_sorted([5])`: `True`\n* `is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`: `True`\n* `is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5])",

The function takes a list of integers as input.\n2. The first check is if the length of the list is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns True, as an empty list is considered sorted.\n3. If the list has more than one element, the function iterates over the list starting from the second element.\n4.

We use a list comprehension to extract the odd digits from the string of digits, and then use the `np.product` function to compute the product of the list of odd digits.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function works:\n\n* `digits(1)` returns `1`, because the only digit is 1, which is odd.\n* `digits(4)` returns `0`, because all the digits are even.\n* `digits(235)` returns `15`, because the only odd digit is 3.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",

The function shall then return the sum of all entries. \n    \n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6\n    For lst = []  the output should be 0\n    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126\n    \"\"\"\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        if i % 3 == 0:\n            result += lst[i] ** 2\n        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:\n            result += lst[i] ** 3\n        else:\n            result += lst[i]\n    return result\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. First, we initialize an empty `result` variable to `0`. This will be the sum of all the squared and cubed values.\n2. Then, we loop through the list `lst` using the `for` loop.\n3. For each entry `lst[i]`, we check if `i % 3 == 0`. If it is, we square the entry and add it to `result`.\n4. If `i % 3",

We iterate over each character in the string using a for loop.\n4. If the character is a letter, we reverse its case by converting it to lowercase if it's uppercase, or uppercase if it's lowercase. We store the reversed character in the `reversed_string` list.\n5. If the character is not a letter (i.e., it's a digit or a special character), we simply append it to the `reversed_string` list as is.\n6. Finally, we return the `reversed_string` list as a string using the `join` method.\n\nHere are",
